# Credit Card Validation Program
## A simple program to check whether credit card number is valid or not. 
<br>

## Usage and Working:
 Clone the project and run the code in `main.java` and enter the Credit Card Number. 
 <br>
 If the card number would be valid it would display the following:
 1. Major Industry Identifier (MII)
 2. Issuer Identification Number (IIN)
 3. Account Number
 4. Check digit

 Otherwise it would display that "The card in Invalid".
